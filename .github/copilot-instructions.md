This project consists of two parts: a FastAPI backend (folder: assistant-srv) and a React frontend (folder: assistant-ui) using Vite. The backend provides APIs in Python; the frontend consumes these APIs with TypeScript for type safety.

* Always run frontend scripts from the assistant-ui directory. For example, `cd {absolute path of project root folder}/assistant-ui && npm run dev`
* Use the scripts in package.json for development, build, and linting.

When implementing features or fixing bugs:

* Log a summary of changes in CHANGELOG.md.
* Document code with clear comments as needed.
* Ensure code meets project standards, is well-tested, and markdown is properly formatted in English.

For Git commits:

* Use clear, concise, English messages summarizing the changes (e.g., "Fix: Corrected API endpoint for user authentication").
