This project consists of two parts: a FastAPI backend (folder: assistant-srv) and a React frontend (folder: assistant-ui) using Vite. The backend provides APIs in Python; the frontend consumes these APIs with TypeScript for type safety.

When implementing features or fixing bugs:

* Make a TODO list when implementing a feature or fixing a bug.
* Log a summary of changes in CHANGELOG.md.
* Document code with clear comments as needed.
* Ensure code meets project standards, is well-tested, and markdown is properly formatted in English.
* Must follow SOLID principles, be secure and efficient. 
* The UI should be responsive, intuitive, and provide a smooth user experience.
* Always run frontend scripts with the command of changing current directory to `assistant-ui` (`cd /home/fengyj/PersonalCodeProjects/assistant/assistant-ui`). For example, `cd {absolute path of project root folder}/assistant-ui && npm run dev`. This is very important, cannot be omitted!
* If need to start the service or build, kill the existing service first.

For Git commits:

* Use clear, concise, English messages summarizing the changes
