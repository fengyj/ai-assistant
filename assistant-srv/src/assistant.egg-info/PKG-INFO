# Personal AI Assistant

This is an AI assistant, unlike the LLM official clients (for example, DeepSeek), it will learn your information from the chat history. The more using, the more better to understand you.

In this app,

1. you can maintain your chat history.
2. you can maintain your personal information. 
3. you can maintain your knowledge base.
4. it can extract your personal information from the chat history, and maintain it, and utilize it in future conversation.
5. it can summarize the conversation if the chatting thread is too long, so you can make longer conversation.
6. it can extract the information from the chat history to make a document, and put it into your knowledge base.
7. you can integrate the LLMs whatever you want, and swith the model during the conversation.
8. you can maintain a prompt list, and it can choose a proper one during the conversation.
9. you can upload multi-media files in the conversation to ask model to do something with them, like extract text from sound file, recognize objects from image, etc.
10. it can extend its capabilities via MCP servers.
